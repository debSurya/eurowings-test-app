# Flight List Demo Application

This is a VUE.js application which demonstrates an admin view of  a list of flights. 
The following are the features of the application:

* The application loads with a pre-populated list of flights present in the list
* The flight details contain **Origin**, **Destination** and **Flight Number**
* There is a separate **Add new flight** section above the list of flights
* To add a new flight to the list, the admin has to add new details via the *origin*, and *destination* autocomplete boxes and a *flight number* input field
* Once added, the backend will validate the flight number and if correct, will repopulate the flight list
